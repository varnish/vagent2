 * Methods (duh).
 *
 * Keep in mind:
 * GET should never affect state.
 * POST can affect state and does not require idempotence.
 * PUT can affect state but has to be idempotent.
 *
 * HEAD is the same as GET, the http-module handles it transparently for
 * us.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * GET /vcl/ - fetches list of VCL
 * POST /vcl/ - uploads a VCL to a dynamic url, multiple uploads leads to
 *              multiple copies.
 * PUT /vcl/ - Error
 * PUT /vcl/name - uploads a VCL to the name specified. Multiple uploads
 *                 will try to overwrite the VCL (which fails, since
 *                 Varnish disallows this)
 * PUT /stop - stops varnish (Can't stop it multiple times now, can we?)
 *
 * etc.
