	"Varnish consists of two processes: The manager and the worker child.\n" \
	"The worker child is the process that does the majority of the work,\n" \
	"while the manager is responsible for \"administrative\" things, like\n" \
	"compiling VCL, talking to the varnish-agent, starting the worker, etc.\n" \
	"\n" \
	"Since the worker is where the majority of the logic lives, this is the one\n" \
	"most vulnerable to bugs. Varnish' typical reaction to bugs is to abort the\n" \
	"worker process and restart it. This typically takes a second or two and can\n" \
	"be hard to notice. It also clears the cache.\n" \
	"\n" \
	"When this occurs, a detailed log is made, which can be retrieved through the\n" \
	"management thread. It is also logged to syslog.\n" \
	"\n" \
	"GET /panic - This retrieves the last panic message\n" \
	"DELETE /panic - This clears the last panic\n" \
	"\n" \
	"Output from GET /panic can be used in bug reports or support tickets.\n" \
	"Keep in mind that not all bugs will be logged here of course. Bugs are tricky.\n"
